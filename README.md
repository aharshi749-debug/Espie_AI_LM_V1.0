# Espie-AI-SGM-runs-on-16kb-

A small AI SGM model meant for small ESP32 Devices, Conceptually works like a LLM, but natively for an ESP32

# What is Espie?

Espie is a small AI SGM where it is like a AI but runs completely locally on a ESP32 with no api or external files (meaning no Openai, groq or any of that is used at all)

# Why this matters?

Because Since Espie runs on a literal microcontroller, this demonstrates that modern AI doesnt need

-GPU clusters

-Water cooling

-Terabytes of Ram

-20 megawatts of serious power

because Espie runs on

-16 KB SRAM Arena and actual 1.4kb being used

-No water cooling

-usually Mah Or sips on small watts per hour

-512/520 kb of SRAM and sometimes just an extra 8MB of PSRAM (sometimes may be 4mb or 2mb but will vary)

AND This demonstrates that an AI text-generation system can run locally on a microcontroller with a very small SRAM working set as low as......16kb...
# What is Espie made out of?

Espie is a AI SGM, not a true llm at all, 

and AI SGM means

Artifical Intelligence Script Generator Model

which means this consists of

-Script/Logic

-Generator Output and Input parser

-Dataset that the Script/Logic references 

meaning this is wayy smaller.

the only thing what makes Espie similar to an LLM , is that it just uses temperature sampling but other than that it is fundamentally different



# QuickStart/Setup for Espie

Step 1: Train Espie by downloading the py and make sure having PyTorch installed

Step 2: Copy the ino file into arduino ide

Step 3: Compile and flash onto a ESP32 chip 

Step 4: Start training the py file, wait until its trained, when its done it should spit out a file named "Espie_1_6_v6m.bin" or a similar file, then go to this site

https://espressif.github.io/esptool-js/

Step 5: There will be a box , change it to 0x3A0000 , like in the image

Step 6: Once you have it ready, click on "Choose File" and select the bin file you just got from training Espie

Step 7: Click the big blue button that says "PROGRAM" to flash it

Step 8: after it finished, press the RST button on your ESP32 and head to serial monitor and press it Again

Step 9: you should be able to start typing and then it would respond back!

# Credits to

-Elias, Joel, my best friends, idk what they did even to this project but idk i just calling him out but i did everything in this project


# A few things to keep in direct mind

I am sorry if its not enough at all, because i am 12 and like i am busy for like....my entire day because i am releasing a new OS soon so like i am sorry if it aint enough, but if you got anything to say, go ahead! go and say it out!
also i will make a few files that are named
"NOTES.txt" that will contain my notes for the full thing on a AI SGM so thanks for cooperating guys (or whoever is reading this)
